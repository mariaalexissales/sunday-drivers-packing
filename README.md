# Easy Packing for Sunday Drivers

My attempt at addressing the **chunk rot issue** on the Sunday Drivers Project Zomboid server.

This mod extends the original **Easy Packing** framework with server-focused improvements to help reduce item clutter, improve container management, and preserve server performance (because yes—we’re all hoarders here).

## ✨ Features
- **Bug fix**: Food items now properly retain their nutrition values when packed and unpacked  
- **CDC and Project Grub Mod compatibility**: Plays nice with both the CDC and PG Farming mod for extended packing use cases  
- Focused on solving chunk rot by encouraging cleaner inventory practices across the server

## 🛠️ Workshop Info

## 🧩 Notes
